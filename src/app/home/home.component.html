            This is the personal web presence of Markus RÃ¶ttgermann.
            I will make use of my little web space to post interests, personal data for potential future employers and use it as
            a personal playground for testing web technologies. I graduated with a Bachelor in computer science on April 2021 and have a passion for exploring new
            technologies. This also led to the creation of this domain.

                <h1>Short Bio</h1>
I was born and raised in the German state Rhineland-Palatinate. After finishing the 10th grade of high school, I focused on economics as my higher education entrance for university. Quickly after claiming my high school diploma, I changed my plans thinking a more practical approach would fit my future plans even more. I decided to attend a 3-year job training which mixes practice and school and leads to a concrete job entrance level. After completing I stayed at my training company for 1 more year before deciding to take a break to explore the beautiful country of Australia. Working and traveling for a year was the most formative experience I made in my life. It led to me changing from the field of economy to Computer Science and gave me a 'can do' attitude to attend university at the age of 24. A few months ago, I graduated from university holding a CS degree and working in a field I dreamed of.
